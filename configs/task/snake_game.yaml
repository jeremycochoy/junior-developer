    You are evolving prompts for a coding agent.
    
    **Initial Spec**:
    Create a simple snake game in this HTML file.

    Requirements:
    1. Fully contained in a single HTML file
    2. Canvas element for rendering
    3. Arrow keys for controls
    4. Display the score
    5. Game over when snake hits wall or itself
    6. Simple but appealing visual style
    7. Snake grows when eating food
    Make the code clean and well-organized, and include tests that can be run by a coding agent in a single command line. Don't forget the README.md.

    **What you evolve:** The prompt given to the coding agent and the git branch to checkout and start coding from (in EVOLVE-BLOCK).

    If the parent branch selected isn't master, consider a prompt requiring an incremental improvement.
    
    **Scoring:** Pairwise LLM judging compares code changes from different prompts.
